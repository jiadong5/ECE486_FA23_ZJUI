### (a) Plant

The plant is a term used to describe the combination of the process and the actuator. It's responsible for tasks like heating a house efficiently and maintaining temperature within a narrow range. The focus is on speed and reliability, often at the expense of pinpoint accuracy.

### (b) Sensors

Sensors in closed-loop control systems act as vital components for monitoring, feedback, and control. They enable the system to react to changes in the environment or process conditions, ensuring that the controlled variable remains as close as possible to the desired setpoint, ultimately enhancing the system's reliability and performance.

### (c) Actuator

Actuator is a key component responsible for carrying out the control commands issued by the controller. Its primary role is to convert the control signal generated by the controller into physical actions or adjustments that influence the controlled process or system.

### (d) Desire State

"Desired State" in a closed-loop control system refers to the target or intended system condition or parameter values set by the operator or designer. It serves as a reference point against which the actual system state is compared.

### (e) Actual State

"Actual State" refers to the real-time or current condition or parameter values of the system being controlled. It represents the system's actual behavior or status at any given moment. 

### (f) feedback

"Feedback" refers to the process of receiving information about the system's current state or performance and using that information to make adjustments or corrections.
